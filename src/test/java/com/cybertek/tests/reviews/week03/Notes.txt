return type of findElement method: WebElement
What kind of exception does it throw? No such element exception
What are the common reasons of no such element exception?
    1. Our locator might be wrong
    2. Maybe developer changed code
    3. Synchronization: Thread.sleep (this method throws exception, and you need to handle it
    you need to add exception to your signature)

CSS Locators:
- Part of the 8 locators we have in selenium
- like Xpath, it allows us for creating custom locators
- NOT limited to name, id or className attributes, you can use other attributes as well
- You can move from a known element to an element which does not have any attribute

2 different syntax:
1. tagName[attribute='value'] ----> shortcut(if you want to be less specific) [attribute='value']

2. second one can be used only with id and class
tagName#iDValue         shortcut(if you want to be less specific) ---> #idValue
tagName.classValue      shortcut(if you want to be less specific) ---> .ClassName

if your css custom locator returns more candidates of WebElements
<yourCSS>:nth-of-type(index): in oder to use this they need to be siblings(under same family)

How to move from Parent to Child
tagName[attribute='value'] > childTagName

div[id='content']>div>h2
#content>div>h2

How to move from child to parent with CSS? You can NOT do it with CSS
With Xpath (XpathLOcator/..)

PIQ: What are the differences between Xpath and CSS?
1. CSS has shorter and more cleaner syntax, maybe little bit faster than xpath
2. we can not locate using text with CSS, but with Xpath we can do it
3. using index, for CSS they have to be under same parent

Erdem's Strategy:
First ID, (check dynamic)
With Class name, check for spaces
attribute and value (check if it is duplicate or first one)
Using parent child relationtry
try the 6 locators first if it does not work
then look for custom locator

For practice purpose: do the same tasks with different locators

PIQ: How do you handle dynamic web elements?
    How do you habdle web elelemnts that has dynamic attribute value?
    Melek: how to understand? refresh
           use custom locators and start with, ends with and contains









isDisplayed() method:
* if the webelement is displayed or Not
* return type: boolean (true/false)
* it does not accept any argument
