Purpose of our dependencies:
        In order to automate Browsers:
        * Selenium-Java Dependency: Version--3.141.59

        * Selenium needs to talk to browsers, there is  a middle man
        WebDriverManager(Driver--binary files (0000110010))
        Without WebDriverManager we need to install each browser (firefox, chrome...)
        manually. If you put the dependency then all these setup is done by the code.

        Let's get the latest one: mvnrepository website
        https://mvnrepository.com/
        search for webdrivermanager

What do we test as a tester? Main Job?
        We need to compare Expected VS Actual
   * Actual comes from : From Application (WebPage)
   * Expected comes from : SRS (system requirements specification)
           Documentation

In order to get the actual data from webpage wih automation, Selenium
comes with ready methods:

1. Finding WebElement is the most important part of it.

2. Locate them (findElement() Method)

3. Aplly an action (click, sendKeys....)

Locators:
    6 Locators (non-custom) - id, name, tagName, ClassName, LinlTExt, PartialLinkText
        id locator: it is always unique, but problem can be dynamic

    2 Locators (custom) : Xpath --- CSS locators
