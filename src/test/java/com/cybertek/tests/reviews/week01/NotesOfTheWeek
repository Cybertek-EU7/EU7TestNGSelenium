1. IntelliJ Settings
        mouse zoom: Settings->Editor -> General -> Mouse Control
        how to find stuff:
            - CTRL+Shift+F  looks inside the whole project
            (MAC: CMND+Shift+F)
            -CTRL+F: looks for only in this file

2. When we create our Selenium project what is the build tool?
        MAVEN ----Built tool  (Gradle, Ant )
        Manage dependencies (libraries)
        Built: repeated steps when creating a project

3. What is automation?
        - If there are repeated steps & process, and you want to reduce human interaction, you can automate process
        ** Benefits of Automation:
        - Precision
        - Reduce mistakes
        - More accurate results
        - Faster and save time for us******
        - Save cost
        - Auto generated reports and these reports can be sent automatically everyday to your colleagues.
                        ( CI/CD Tools: Jenkins-- this one runs codes automatically and generate emails)
4. What is Selenium?
        * just a library (ready classes created for web automation)
        * you can only automate web based applications, you can NOT do desktop apps automation

5. In Selenium we will learn bunch of Methods:
        #1 What is the method doing?
        #2 Does it accept any arguments (parameters) ?
        #3 Does it return anything? What is the return type?
        #4 Does it throw an exception? // we need to handle the exception-----
     example: get() method
     #1- This gets the given url in an already opened browser
     #2- This method accepts String as an argument-- url
     #3- void method, not returning
