    1. New Application ----> New Project : Testing Framework (TestNG, BDD: Behavioral Driven Development: Cucumber Framework)
                - MAVEN project: it requires pom.xml (created first) managing the project
                            - pom.xml: dependencies, JDK level, Maven tools will be controlled
                - Utility Package: Driver, ConfigurationReader(to read properties), Project based utility classes
                - Parent of Test Cases: TestBase
                - If you are using Page Object Model design concept: need to create pages of your application
                - Create Test Cases

    XML Runners:
        XML files have no predefined tags
        pom.xml ---> only means something to MAVEN
        testNGRunners make sense only for TestNG
